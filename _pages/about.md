Welcome to my personal website!

I am a high-energy physicist working on CERN's ATLAS experiment as a graduate student. Broadly, my research up to now has focused on the search for rare Higgs boson production modes in the diphoton decay signal channel.
When I'm not coding something, I enjoy announcing roller derby bouts for the Kalamazoo Derby Darlins, running a Dungeons and Dragons table or two, and attempting to hand-train my two parakeets, Ares and Hermes.

If youâ€™re interested, feel free to have a look at my GitHub page where you can view some of my ongoing projects and previous work in high-energy physics.

For more info, please contact me via email!
