Welcome to my personal website!

I am a machine learning scientist with a wide ranging set of interests, but am especially excited by applied computer vision research on hyperspectral imagery and what it can teach us about representation learning.
As a graduate student, I worked on high-energy physics analyses on CERN's ATLAS experiment, where I played a key role in the discovery of top-associated Higgs production, one of the flagship results of the Large Hadron Collider's second run. Similarly, as a Machine Learning Scientist at IntelinAir, I have developed everything from Vision Transformers to Viterbi Decoders in order to model the growth status of corn and soybean fields throughout their lifecycles.

When I'm not coding something, I enjoy gardening, playing the banjo, announcing my friends' roller derby bouts, cryptic crosswords, and hanging out with Molly Grue, my horrible, no-good, very bad dog.

If youâ€™re interested, feel free to have a look at my GitHub page where you can view some of my side projects!
